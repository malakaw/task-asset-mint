;; If you’re new to CIDER it is highly recommended to go through its
;; user manual first. Type <M-x cider-view-manual> to view it.
;; In case you’re seeing any warnings you should consult the manual’s
;; "Troubleshooting" section.
;;
;; Here are few tips to get you started:
;;
;; * Press <C-h m> to see a list of the keybindings available (this
;;   will work in every Emacs buffer)
;; * Press <,> to quickly invoke some REPL command
;; * Press <C-c C-z> to switch between the REPL and a Clojure file
;; * Press <M-.> to jump to the source of something (e.g. a var, a
;;   Java method)
;; * Press <C-c C-d C-d> to view the documentation for something (e.g.
;;   a var, a Java method)
;; * Print CIDER’s refcard and keep it close to your keyboard.
;;
;; CIDER is super customizable - try <M-x customize-group cider> to
;; get a feel for this. If you’re thirsty for knowledge you should try
;; <M-x cider-drink-a-sip>.
;;
;; If you think you’ve encountered a bug (or have some suggestions for
;; improvements) use <M-x cider-report-bug> to report it.
;;
;; Above all else - don’t panic! In case of an emergency - procure
;; some (hard) cider and enjoy it responsibly!
;;
;; You can remove this message with the <M-x cider-repl-clear-help-banner> command.
;; You can disable it from appearing on start by setting
;; ‘cider-repl-display-help-banner’ to nil.
